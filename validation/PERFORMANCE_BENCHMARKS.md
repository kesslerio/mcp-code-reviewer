# Performance Benchmarks for Validation Scripts

## Overview

This document provides performance benchmarks and timing thresholds for the validation scripts in the Vibe Check MCP project. These benchmarks help monitor execution performance and detect regressions.

## Timing Thresholds

### Default Warning Thresholds
- **Per-operation threshold**: 1.0 second
- **Total validation threshold**: 5.0 seconds
- **Individual pattern detection**: 100ms

### Performance Expectations

#### detect_patterns.py
- **Cognee case validation**: < 50ms
- **Good case validation**: < 50ms  
- **Additional test cases (5 cases)**: < 200ms total
- **Total script execution**: < 500ms

#### comprehensive_test.py
- **File loading operations**: < 10ms each
- **Example extraction**: < 50ms each
- **Individual pattern detection**: < 20ms each
- **Total script execution**: < 300ms

## Benchmark Results

### Initial Baseline (v1.0)
These are the expected baseline performance metrics for initial implementation:

| Operation | Expected Time | Warning Threshold | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|-------|
| Pattern Detection (single) | 5-15ms | 100ms | Core detection algorithm |
| File Loading | 2-5ms | 50ms | Sample code file reading |
| Regex Processing | 1-3ms | 20ms | Pattern matching operations |
| Full Validation Suite | 100-300ms | 1000ms | Complete test run |

### Performance Monitoring

#### Key Metrics to Track
1. **Total execution time** - Overall script performance
2. **Per-test timing** - Individual operation performance
3. **Regression detection** - Comparing against baselines
4. **Memory usage** - Resource consumption patterns

#### Warning Indicators
- ⚠️ Operations exceeding 1 second threshold
- ⚠️ 50%+ increase from baseline times
- ⚠️ Memory usage spikes
- ⚠️ Inconsistent timing patterns

## Usage

### Running with Timing
```bash
# Standard validation with timing
python validation/detect_patterns.py

# Comprehensive testing with timing
python validation/comprehensive_test.py
```

### Interpreting Results
The timing output includes:
- **Individual operation times** - Each test/validation step
- **Summary statistics** - Min/max/average times
- **Warning alerts** - Operations exceeding thresholds
- **Detailed breakdown** - Verbose timing information

### Example Output

## Regression Detection

### Baseline Updates
Update benchmarks when:
- Major algorithm improvements are made
- Infrastructure changes affect performance
- New test cases are added significantly

### Performance Regression Criteria
Consider a performance regression if:
- Total execution time increases by >50%
- Individual operations exceed warning thresholds consistently
- New operations don't follow expected patterns

## Optimization Guidelines

### Performance Best Practices
1. **Minimize file I/O** - Cache loaded content when possible
2. **Optimize regex patterns** - Use efficient regex patterns
3. **Batch operations** - Group similar operations together
4. **Profile bottlenecks** - Use detailed timing to identify slow operations

### Threshold Adjustments
- Adjust thresholds based on hardware capabilities
- Consider different thresholds for CI/CD vs development environments
- Update baselines after confirmed performance improvements

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Performance Features
1. **Memory usage tracking** - Monitor resource consumption
2. **Parallel processing** - Speed up independent operations
3. **Caching mechanisms** - Reduce redundant computations
4. **Performance profiles** - Different configs for different environments

### Monitoring Integration
- Integration with CI/CD pipeline performance checks
- Automated benchmark regression detection
- Performance trend analysis over time
