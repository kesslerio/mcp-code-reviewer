# GitHub Project Setup Guide: Claude v6 Cognee RAG Implementation

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up the GitHub project structure, milestones, and issues for the Claude v6 Cognee RAG implementation project.

## 1. Create the GitHub Project

1. Navigate to the repository on GitHub
2. Click on the "Projects" tab
3. Click "New project"
4. Select "Board" as the template
5. Name the project "Claude v6 Cognee RAG Implementation"
6. Add a brief description: "Implementation of Cognee.ai RAG pipeline for token-efficient content handling in Claude v6"
7. Click "Create"

## 2. Configure Project Views

1. Create the following columns in the board view:
   - Backlog
   - Ready
   - In Progress
   - Review
   - Done

2. Add a Table view with the following fields:
   - Title
   - Status
   - Milestone
   - Priority
   - Assignee
   - Labels

3. Add filters for easy navigation:
   - By milestone
   - By priority
   - By area label

## 3. Create Milestones

Create the following milestones using the GitHub interface:

1. Go to the "Issues" tab
2. Click "Milestones"
3. Click "New milestone"
4. Create each milestone from the `cognee_milestones.md` file:
   - Milestone 1: Environment Setup and Proof of Concept (2 weeks)
   - Milestone 2: Reference System Integration (2 weeks)
   - Milestone 3: Parallel Build System Implementation (3 weeks)
   - Milestone 4: Testing and Optimization (2 weeks)
   - Milestone 5: Documentation and Training (1 week)

For each milestone:
- Add the title
- Copy the description from the milestone document
- Set the due date (2-3 weeks from the previous milestone)
- Click "Create milestone"

## 4. Import Issues

Create the issues defined in the `cognee_issues.md` file:

2. For each issue in the document:
   - Click "New issue"
   - Select the appropriate template (Cognee Feature or Cognee Bug)
   - Fill in the title and description
   - Apply the labels as specified
   - Assign to the appropriate milestone
   - Set the priority label (P0, P1, P2, etc.)
   - Click "Submit new issue"

Alternatively, use the GitHub CLI to create issues in batch:

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI if not already installed
brew install gh

# Login to GitHub
gh auth login

# Create issues from a CSV or JSON file
# (You would need to convert the markdown issues to a compatible format)
gh issue create --title "Feature: Set up Cognee.ai environment and dependencies" --body "..." --label "feature,P2,area:build,status:ready" --milestone "Milestone 1"
```

## 5. Link Issues to the Project

1. Go back to the project board
2. Click "+ Add items"
3. Select all the created issues
4. Click "Add selected items"
5. Organize the issues in the appropriate columns (all should start in "Backlog" or "Ready")

## 6. Set Up Project Automation

Create automation rules to streamline project management:

1. In the project, click on the three dots (...) and select "Project settings"
2. Click on "Workflows"
3. Set up the following workflows:
   - When an issue is assigned, move it to "In Progress"
   - When a pull request linked to an issue is merged, move the issue to "Review"
   - When an issue is closed, move it to "Done"

## 7. Configure Labels

Ensure all required labels are available in the repository:

1. Go to "Issues" > "Labels"
2. Create any missing labels:
   - Priority labels: P0, P1, P2, P3, P4, P5
   - Type labels: feature, bug, enhancement, documentation, test
   - Status labels: status:blocked, status:in-progress, status:ready, status:review, status:needs-info, status:untriaged
   - Area labels: area:core, area:sales, area:customer_success, area:build, area:dist, area:sdr, area:ae, area:shared, area:core_data, area:qualification, area:closing, area:support, area:build_system, area:packaging, area:optimization, area:testing, area:documentation, area:performance, area:refactor

## 8. Document Development Workflow

Create a pull request template to ensure consistent contributions:

1. Create a file at `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` with the following content:

```markdown
## Description
<!-- Describe the changes in this PR -->

<!-- Describe how you tested these changes -->

## Checklist
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Tests added/updated

- [ ] All checks are passing

## Screenshots (if applicable)
<!-- Add screenshots to help explain your changes -->
```

## 9. Share With the Team

Once the project is set up:

1. Send an announcement to the team with:
   - Link to the project board
   - Brief overview of the project structure
   - Guidelines for working on issues
   - Timeline for major milestones

2. Schedule a kickoff meeting to:
   - Walk through the project structure
   - Discuss priorities and assignments
