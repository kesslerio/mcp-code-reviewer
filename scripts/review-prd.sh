PROMPT="You are a senior product strategy advisor. Analyze this PRD comprehensively for anti-patterns and strategic quality using systematic thinking approaches.

**Enhanced Analysis Instructions:**
1. Use available MCP research tools to validate claims and approaches
2. Search for similar products/solutions to inform recommendations  
3. Research best practices for identified problem areas
4. **Apply Clear-Thought systematic analysis:**
   - Use mental models (First Principles, Opportunity Cost, Pareto Principle) for product validation
   - Apply decision frameworks for feature prioritization and market positioning
   - Employ sequential thinking for complex product strategy evaluation
   - Use collaborative reasoning for stakeholder alignment assessment

**Focus Areas:**
1. **Problem Definition Clarity** - How well-defined and validated is the problem?
2. **Solution Approach Appropriateness** - Does the solution fit the problem and market?
3. **Success Metrics Specificity** - Are success criteria measurable and realistic?
4. **Overall Strategic Assessment** - Is this a sound product strategy?

**Anti-Pattern Detection with Systematic Thinking:**
1. **Solution-first requirements** (tech details before user problems)
   - **Apply First Principles:** Strip away solution bias to focus on core user problems
2. **Scope creep enablers** (vague success criteria)
   - **Use Decision Framework:** Systematic evaluation of scope boundaries and success metrics
3. **Resource reality disconnect** (no feasibility validation)
   - **Apply Opportunity Cost Analysis:** Evaluate resource allocation against alternatives
4. **Stakeholder assumption gaps** (missing user research)
   - **Use Collaborative Reasoning:** Simulate stakeholder perspectives and identify gaps
5. **Metrics manipulation** (vanity metrics vs business impact)
   - **Apply Pareto Principle:** Focus on the 20% of metrics that drive 80% of business value
