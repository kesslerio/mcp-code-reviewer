## 2. Architecture Decision: MCP Server vs. Direct CLI

### 2.1 Systematic Analysis Framework

#### **First Principles Analysis**

**What are we fundamentally trying to achieve?**
1. **Local execution** with Claude Code CLI integration
2. **Easy workflow integration** for the user
3. **Educational anti-pattern prevention** as core value
4. **Future extensibility** for additional integrations

**What are the core trade-offs?**

| Approach | Pros | Cons | User Experience |
|----------|------|------|-----------------|
| **Direct CLI** | Simple implementation, direct control | Limited integration, manual workflow | `anti-pattern-coach issue 123` |
| **MCP Server** | Seamless Claude integration, extensible | More complex architecture | `claude -p @anti-pattern-coach "analyze issue 123"` |
| **Hybrid** | Best of both worlds | Development complexity | Both interfaces available |

#### **User Workflow Analysis**

**Current User Workflow (Direct CLI)**:
```bash
# User has to context-switch between tools
claude -p "analyze this code for issues"
anti-pattern-coach issue 123  # separate command
anti-pattern-coach pr 456     # separate command
```

**Desired User Workflow (MCP Integration)**:
```bash
# Seamless integration within Claude Code workflow
claude -p @anti-pattern-coach "analyze issue 123 for anti-patterns"
claude -p "review this PR @anti-pattern-coach check for systematic patterns"
```

## 3. Technical Implementation Recommendations

### 3.1 MCP Server Architecture

#### **FastMCP Server Structure**
```python
# vibe_compass_server.py
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("Vibe Compass MCP")

@mcp.tool()
def analyze_issue(issue_number: int, repository: str = None) -> dict:
    """Analyze GitHub issue for anti-patterns"""
    return {
        "patterns": detected_patterns,
        "educational_content": explanations,
        "confidence": scores,
        "recommendations": alternatives
    }

@mcp.tool()  
def analyze_code(code: str, context: str = None) -> dict:
    """Analyze code content for systematic anti-patterns"""
    return analysis_result

@mcp.tool()
def check_integration(service: str, approach: str) -> dict:
    """Validate integration approach against anti-patterns"""
    return validation_result

@mcp.tool()
def explain_pattern(pattern_id: str) -> dict:
    """Provide educational content about specific anti-pattern"""
    return educational_content
```

#### **MCP Tool Design Principles**
- **Single Responsibility**: Each tool has one clear purpose
- **Educational Output**: Every response includes WHY and HOW
- **Confidence Scoring**: Clear indicators of analysis certainty
- **Structured Responses**: JSON format for easy parsing by Claude
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with helpful messages

### 3.2 Claude Code Integration Patterns

#### **User Interaction Examples**
```bash
# Natural language interaction with MCP tools
claude -p @anti-pattern-coach "analyze issue 123 for infrastructure anti-patterns"

# Complex multi-step analysis
claude -p "Review this PR and @anti-pattern-coach check for systematic patterns, then suggest improvements"

# Educational queries
claude -p "@anti-pattern-coach explain infrastructure-without-implementation pattern with examples"

# Integration validation
claude -p "@anti-pattern-coach check if building a custom HTTP client for Stripe is an anti-pattern"
```

#### **MCP Server Configuration**
```json
// Claude Code MCP configuration
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "anti-pattern-coach": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "vibe_compass.server"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_TOKEN": "optional"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 3.3 Standalone CLI Interface

#### **CLI Commands (Secondary Interface)**
```bash
# For users who prefer direct commands or when MCP unavailable
anti-pattern-coach issue 123
anti-pattern-coach code --file src/main.py  
anti-pattern-coach explain infrastructure-without-implementation
anti-pattern-coach config --setup-mcp
```

#### **CLI Implementation**
```python
# cli/main.py - delegates to MCP server locally
import click
from .mcp_client import local_mcp_call

@click.command()
@click.argument('issue_number')
def issue(issue_number):
    """Analyze issue for anti-patterns"""
    result = local_mcp_call('analyze_issue', {'issue_number': issue_number})
    display_educational_output(result)
```
