# Vibe Check MCP Usage Guide

Complete guide for using the enhanced Vibe Check MCP framework with Claude Code CLI for comprehensive engineering vibe checks and friendly coaching guidance.

## Quick Start

Once you have Vibe Check MCP configured (see [README.md](../README.md)), you can analyze GitHub issues using natural language commands.

## Command Line Interface

### Direct CLI Usage

Set up a shell alias for natural command syntax:

```bash
# Add to your ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, or ~/.fish_config
alias vibe='python -m vibe_check.cli'

# Now you can use:
vibe check issue 31
deep vibe issue 31
vibe check issue 31 in microsoft/typescript
```

### Natural Language Commands

**Quick Analysis**:
```bash
vibe check issue 31
vibe check issue 42 in facebook/react
```

**Deep Analysis** (comprehensive mode with educational content):
```bash
deep vibe issue 31
deep vibe issue 42 in microsoft/typescript
```

## GitHub Issue Vibe Check Analysis

The enhanced Vibe Check MCP provides friendly, coaching-oriented analysis with Claude-powered reasoning and educational guidance.

### Two Analysis Modes

**üöÄ Quick Vibe Check** (fast feedback for development workflow):
```

## GitHub Integration

### Enhanced GitHub Comment Posting

When you use **deep vibe check mode**, the enhanced Vibe Check framework automatically posts a friendly, coaching-oriented comment to the GitHub issue.

**Enhanced Comment Format**:
```markdown
## üéØ Deep Vibe Check

**Overall Vibe:** üîç Research Vibes

### üí´ Vibe Summary
üîç Let's do some homework first! This would benefit from researching existing solutions and checking official documentation before diving in.

```

### Issue Labeling

Deep vibe check analysis automatically adds helpful labels to issues and provides comprehensive coaching in the comments.

## üéØ The Five Vibe Levels

The enhanced framework assesses issues across 5 friendly vibe levels:

### ‚úÖ **Good Vibes**
- **What it means**: "This looks like a solid plan! The approach seems well thought out and appropriately scoped."
- **When you see this**: Issue has clear requirements, appropriate complexity, good research
- **What to do**: Proceed with implementation following the plan

### üîç **Research Vibes** 
- **What it means**: "Let's do some homework first! This would benefit from researching existing solutions."
- **When you see this**: Missing research phase, no existing solution analysis
- **What to do**: Check documentation, find working examples, research existing tools

### üß™ **POC Vibes**
- **What it means**: "Show us it works first! Let's prove the basic functionality with a simple proof-of-concept."
- **When you see this**: Third-party integration without basic API validation
- **What to do**: Create minimal POC, test basic functionality, validate assumptions

### ‚öñÔ∏è **Complex Vibes**
- **What it means**: "This feels pretty complex! Have we considered if there's a simpler approach?"
- **When you see this**: High complexity indicators, over-engineering patterns
- **What to do**: Question necessity, try simple approaches first, justify complexity

### üö® **Bad Vibes**
- **What it means**: "Hold up! This looks like building infrastructure without proving the basics work."
- **When you see this**: Infrastructure-without-implementation patterns detected
- **What to do**: Stop and start with basic API usage, focus on fundamentals

## Best Practices

### When to Use Quick Vibe Check
- **Development workflow**: Fast feedback during issue planning
- **Daily standup prep**: Quick assessment before discussing issues
- **Issue triage**: Rapid scanning of multiple issues for risk assessment
- **Personal development**: Understanding your own engineering approach

### When to Use Deep Vibe Check  
- **Team code reviews**: When you want to share analysis with team members
- **Educational moments**: When you want full coaching content and learning opportunities
- **Issue documentation**: Creating permanent record of engineering guidance
- **Mentoring sessions**: Teaching junior developers about engineering best practices
- **Pre-implementation validation**: Before starting complex or risky work

### Repository Context

If you're working within a repository, Vibe Check will default to analyzing issues in that repository:

```bash
# In /path/to/my-project
cd /path/to/my-project
claude -p "analyze issue 23"  # Analyzes issue 23 in current repo
```

For cross-repository analysis, always specify the repository:
```
analyze issue 23 in microsoft/typescript
```

## Ensuring Tool Selection

### When Vibe Check Isn't Selected Automatically

Sometimes Claude may not automatically choose the Vibe Check tool for analysis. Here's how to ensure it gets used:

**Explicit Tool References**:
```
use Vibe Check to analyze issue 35
analyze issue 35 with Vibe Check
Vibe Check: check issue 35 for anti-patterns
```

**Anti-Pattern Keywords** (triggers tool selection):
```
analyze issue 35 for anti-patterns
check issue 35 for patterns
scan issue 35 for engineering anti-patterns
anti-pattern analysis of issue 35
```

**Specific Mode Requests**:
```
run comprehensive anti-pattern analysis on issue 35
do a quick vibe check on issue 35  
systematic pattern analysis of issue 35
```

> **üìù Note**: "Vibe check" phrasing works well and may become the official tool name ([see Issue #39](https://github.com/kesslerio/vibe-check-mcp/issues/39)).

### Tool Selection Debugging

**Check Available Tools**:
```
what MCP tools are available?
list Vibe Check capabilities
show me the Vibe Check server status
```

**Verify Tool Registration**:
If Vibe Check isn't available, check your MCP configuration:
```bash
claude mcp list | grep vibe
```

**Force Tool Usage**:
When Claude uses other tools instead, explicitly request:
```
instead, use the Vibe Check analyze_github_issue tool
please use vibe-check:analyze_github_issue for this
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Vibe Check tool not found"**:
- Check MCP server registration: `claude mcp list`
- Verify server is running: `claude mcp status vibe-check`
- Re-add server if needed (see [README.md](../README.md))

**"Failed to fetch issue"**:
- Check that the issue number exists
- Verify repository name format (owner/repo)
- Ensure GitHub CLI (`gh`) is authenticated

**"GitHub comment posting failed"**:
- Verify you have write access to the repository
- Check that GitHub token is properly configured
- Ensure GitHub CLI is authenticated with sufficient permissions

**"No patterns detected"**:
- This is actually good! It means no anti-patterns were found
- Try comprehensive mode for more detailed analysis
- Check that the issue content contains sufficient detail

**"Claude doesn't use Vibe Check automatically"**:
- Use more specific language (see "Ensuring Tool Selection" above)
- Include "anti-pattern" or "Vibe Check" in your prompt
- Be explicit: "use Vibe Check to analyze..."

### Authentication Setup

Ensure GitHub CLI is properly authenticated:
```bash
gh auth status
gh auth login  # If not authenticated
```

## Advanced Features
