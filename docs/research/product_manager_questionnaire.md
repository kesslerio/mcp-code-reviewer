## Product Strategy Questions

### 1. Target Audience Prioritization
**Question**: Who should we focus on first for initial adoption and validation?

**Options** (rank 1-4, with 1 being highest priority):
- [1] **Individual developers using Claude Code CLI personally**
  - Rationale: _[Why this audience? What's the adoption path?]_
    - Mostly vibe coders who are not developers and need to have technical support to review their plans/issues/code PRs.
- [3] **Development teams within organizations** 
  - Rationale: _[Team adoption vs. individual? Process integration needs?]_
- [2] **Open source maintainers**
  - Rationale: _[Community impact vs. commercial? Visibility benefits?]_
- [4] **Enterprise engineering teams with formal processes**
  - Rationale: _[Enterprise sales vs. grassroots adoption? Formal validation needs?]_

**Follow-up**: What specific user persona should we build for first? (e.g., "Senior engineer at 50-person startup who currently uses review-issue.sh daily")

**Answer**: 
```
PRIMARY PERSONA: "Alex the Vibe Coder" - Product Manager/Technical Lead

PROFILE:
- Role: Senior Product Manager or Technical Marketing Lead at mid-stage SaaS startup (50-200 employees)
- Background: MBA + bootcamp/self-taught coding (3 years PM, 1.5 years development)
- Technical Stack: Python, JavaScript, Claude Desktop for coding assistance
- Development Style: "Ship fast, iterate later" mentality

ANTI-PATTERN TENDENCIES:
1. Infrastructure Without Implementation: Builds custom HTTP clients instead of using maintained SDKs
   - Trigger: "I need more control over API calls"
   - Reality: Standard SDK would work fine with less maintenance burden

2. Symptom-Driven Development: Adds caching layers when APIs are slow
   - Trigger: "Users are complaining about performance" 
   - Reality: Root cause is inefficient database queries

3. Complexity Escalation: Implements microservices for simple CRUD apps
   - Trigger: "We need to scale like Netflix"
   - Reality: Monolithic approach would serve needs for years

4. Documentation Neglect: Starts building before reading official guides
   - Trigger: "Documentation is too long, I'll figure it out"
   - Reality: Wastes days on patterns official docs solve in minutes

PAIN POINTS:
- Time pressure conflicts between PM duties and technical implementation
- Previous "quick fixes" now cause cascading technical debt
- Team developers struggle with their implementation choices
- Limited time to research best practices, relies heavily on AI coding assistants

MOTIVATIONS:
- Ship user-facing value quickly for stakeholder demos
- Build reputation as technical product leader
- Enable engineering team with better technical decisions
- Learn and grow technical skills while maintaining PM responsibilities

IDEAL TOOL INTERACTION:
- Real-time prevention: "Alert me BEFORE I spend hours on wrong approach"
- Educational guidance: "Show me WHY this is anti-pattern and what to do instead"
- Velocity preservation: "Don't slow me down, but keep me on right path"
- Team alignment: "Help me make decisions engineering team will thank me for"

ADOPTION PATH:
1. Individual use during issue planning and PR creation
2. Integration with Claude Desktop workflow for immediate feedback
3. Sharing successful prevention examples with engineering team
4. Evangelizing tool to similar PM/technical leads in network
```

### 2. Distribution Strategy & Success Metrics
**Question**: What's the primary success metric that validates product-market fit?

**Primary Metric** (choose one):
- [x] **Number of GitHub repo stars** 
  - Target: _[How many installations in first 6 months?]_
- [ ] **Prevention of specific anti-pattern incidents**
  - Target: _[How do we measure prevented failures? Self-reported?]_
- [ ] **Community adoption and contributions**
  - Target: _[GitHub stars? Community PRs? Integration by other tools?]_
- [ ] **Commercial licensing/enterprise adoption**
  - Target: _[Paid enterprise features? Support contracts?]_

**Secondary Metrics** (check all that apply):
- [ ] Daily active usage
- [ ] Time saved per code review
- [ ] Reduction in technical debt
- [x] Developer satisfaction scores
- [ ] Other: _[specify]_

**Answer**: 
```
PRIMARY METRIC REASONING: GitHub repo stars (targeting 100+ in first 6 months)

HONEST MOTIVATION:
I'm primarily building this for myself - I experience these anti-patterns constantly and want prevention tools integrated into my Claude Desktop workflow. The external validation is a bonus, not the driver.

VALIDATION SIGNALS:
- GitHub stars as social proof that other "vibe coders" resonate with the problem
- Contributors/PRs as signal that solution is valuable enough for others to improve
- Developer satisfaction scores from anyone who actually uses it regularly

TARGET METRICS:
- Primary: 100+ GitHub stars in 6 months (validates problem resonance)
- Secondary: 5+ meaningful contributors (validates solution quality)
- Secondary: 80%+ satisfaction from any regular users (validates daily workflow value)

WHY THESE METRICS WORK:
1. **Stars = Problem Validation**: Easy way to gauge if other developers face the same anti-pattern pain
2. **Contributors = Solution Validation**: People only contribute to tools they find genuinely useful
3. **Personal Success**: Even if only I use it daily, the tool succeeds if it prevents my anti-patterns

LOW-PRESSURE APPROACH:
- Build for personal use first, optimize for my workflow
- Open source from day one to attract like-minded developers
- Let community adoption happen organically rather than forcing it
- Focus on quality/usefulness over growth metrics

NETWORK EFFECT POTENTIAL:
If the tool genuinely helps me (and others like me), natural evangelism will happen through:
- Sharing prevention wins in developer communities
- Demonstrating anti-pattern catches in code reviews
- Word-of-mouth among product managers who code
```

### 3. Scope Boundaries & Feature Creep
**Question**: How strict should we be about the 4 core anti-patterns from the Cognee retrospective?

**Core Anti-Pattern Focus**:
- [ ] **Strict Focus**: Only the 4 documented patterns, resist general code quality features
- [ ] **Adjacent Patterns**: Include related patterns from your experience (specify below)
- [ ] **Gradual Expansion**: Start with 4, add patterns based on user feedback
- [x] **Broader Quality**: Position as general code quality tool with anti-pattern specialization

**Adjacent Anti-Patterns to Consider** (if applicable):
```
[List any additional patterns you've observed that cause similar systematic failures]
```

**Generic Linting Requests Strategy**:
- [ ] **Redirect**: Point users to existing tools (Ruff, PyLint, etc.)
- [x] **Integrate**: Wrap existing tools but focus on anti-pattern context
- [ ] **Hybrid**: Support basic linting with anti-pattern emphasis

**Answer**: 
```
[Your scope strategy and reasoning]
```

## Technical Decision Points

### 4. Integration Dependencies & Complexity
**Question**: What's your tolerance for external dependencies that users must install?

**Dependency Tolerance** (for each, rate: Essential / Acceptable / Avoid):

- **Clear-Thought MCP server** (requires separate installation): Acceptable
  - Impact: Enhanced systematic analysis capabilities
- **GitHub API integration** (requires token setup): Essential
  - Impact: Full PR/issue analysis automation
- **Ruff/Bandit subprocess calls** (vs. pure Python): Essential
  - Impact: Performance vs. simplicity trade-off
- **Claude Code CLI requirement** (vs. API key option): Acceptable
  - Impact: Your preferred approach vs. broader accessibility

**Installation Complexity Preference**:
- [x] **Single Command**: `pip install mcp-code-reviewer` (everything bundled)
- [ ] **Modular**: Core + optional components (`pip install mcp-code-reviewer[github,security]`)
- [ ] **External**: Allow external tool dependencies with clear setup docs

**Answer**: 
```
[Your dependency preferences and reasoning]
```

### 5. Performance vs. Accuracy Trade-offs
**Question**: What's more important for user adoption and daily workflow integration?

**Primary Optimization Target**:
- [ ] **Speed**: <2 second response time, some false negatives acceptable
- [x] **Accuracy**: 5-10 second comprehensive analysis, minimize false positives
- [ ] **Configurable**: Fast default with optional deep analysis modes
- [ ] **Context-Aware**: Speed for real-time, accuracy for PR reviews

**Acceptable Response Times**:
- Real-time code analysis (IDE integration): 120 seconds
- Issue analysis (planning phase): 180 seconds  
- PR review (formal review): 300 seconds
- Codebase audit (batch analysis): 10 minutes

**False Positive Tolerance**:
- [x] **Low**: Users will stop using if too many false alarms
- [ ] **Medium**: Acceptable if confidence scores provided
- [ ] **High**: Better to over-warn than miss real issues

**Answer**: 
```
ACCURACY-FIRST PHILOSOPHY: Last bastion before grave mistakes

CONTEXT MATTERS:
Anti-pattern detection is fundamentally different from real-time linting. This tool operates at critical decision points where someone is about to:
- Commit to a complex custom solution instead of using standard APIs
- Implement infrastructure without validating the basic approach first
- Choose a symptom-driven fix that creates cascading technical debt
- Skip documentation research and build something unnecessary

STAKES ARE HIGH:
These aren't cosmetic code quality issues - they're architectural decisions that can:
- Lead to 2+ years of technical debt (like Cognee retrospective)
- Cause systematic failures across entire projects
- Waste weeks/months of development time
- Create maintenance nightmares for entire teams

ACCURACY > SPEED RATIONALE:
1. **Decision Points**: Reviews happen when someone is planning/committing to an approach
2. **Time Context**: 2-5 minutes for analysis is trivial compared to weeks of wrong implementation
3. **Prevention Value**: Catching one major anti-pattern saves exponentially more time than fast detection
4. **User Tolerance**: "Alex the Vibe Coder" will wait 5 minutes to avoid months of technical debt

FALSE POSITIVE DANGER:
- Low tolerance because users will ignore/disable tool if it cries wolf
- Better to have high confidence in fewer detections than noisy comprehensive scanning
- Focus on clear, well-documented anti-patterns rather than edge cases
- Each detection should come with strong evidence and clear remediation path

PERFORMANCE TARGETS EXPLAINED:
- 120s real-time: Enough time for thorough analysis before committing to approach
- 180s issue planning: Deep analysis during architecture decision phase
- 300s PR review: Comprehensive review before merge/deployment
- 10min codebase audit: Periodic systematic review, not time-critical

QUALITY OVER QUANTITY:
Rather than catching every possible issue quickly, focus on catching the high-impact anti-patterns accurately with actionable guidance.
```

### 6. Knowledge Base Evolution Strategy
**Question**: How should anti-pattern definitions and detection rules evolve over time?

**Update Mechanism**:
- [ ] **Static**: JSON files updated with software releases (predictable, versioned)
- [ ] **Dynamic**: Pattern updates via web service (always current, requires connectivity)
- [x] **Hybrid**: Local defaults + optional online updates
- [ ] **Community**: GitHub-based pattern contributions with review process

**Learning Integration**:
- [x] **Manual**: Pattern updates based on reported issues/feedback
- [ ] **Semi-Automated**: Suggested patterns from user corrections
- [ ] **ML-Assisted**: Pattern detection improvement via usage analytics
- [ ] **Static Only**: No learning, focus on proven patterns

**Version Control Strategy**:
- [x] **Semantic Versioning**: Breaking changes to pattern detection
- [ ] **Pattern Versioning**: Users can specify pattern set versions
- [ ] **Backward Compatible**: Only additive pattern changes

**Answer**: 
```
[Your knowledge evolution strategy and reasoning]
