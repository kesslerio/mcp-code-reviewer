# AI Doom Loop Detection

## Problem Statement

**Vibe Coding Doom Loop**: Users get "80% of the way there" with AI-generated solutions, then spend days in cycles where each AI fix creates new problems, leading to increasing complexity and frustration.

Research shows this is a common pattern where developers "paste in error messages, and get a fix in response but then something breaks somewhere else" repeatedly.

## Feature Concept

**AI Doom Loop Detection** identifies when users are stuck in unproductive AI-assisted debugging cycles and suggests breaking out with simpler approaches.

## Detection Patterns

### Primary Indicators
- **Error-Fix-Error Cycles**: Multiple rounds of AI fixes that introduce new errors
- **Complexity Escalation**: Solutions becoming more complex with each iteration
- **Context Explosion**: Growing context size without meaningful progress
- **Time Investment Warning**: Spending >2 hours on what should be simple problems

### Secondary Indicators  
- **Stack Trace Similarity**: Similar error types repeating across sessions
- **Dependency Creep**: Adding multiple libraries to solve simple problems
- **Configuration Sprawl**: Complex configurations for basic functionality
- **Multiple Workaround Layers**: Stacking workarounds instead of addressing root causes

## Intervention Strategies

### Break-Out Suggestions
1. **"Reset with Simplicity"**: Suggest starting over with the simplest possible approach
2. **"Check for Standard Libraries"**: Verify if a well-established library solves the core problem
3. **"Minimal Viable Solution"**: Focus on basic functionality first, optimization later
4. **"Step Back Prompt"**: Suggest better prompting strategies that encourage simpler solutions

### Educational Content
- **Case Studies**: Real examples of doom loops and their simple solutions
- **Pattern Recognition**: Help users identify when they're in a loop
- **Recovery Strategies**: Proven approaches for breaking out of complexity spirals

## Implementation Approach

### Real-Time Detection
- Monitor AI coding session patterns through MCP integration
- Track error-fix cycles and complexity metrics
- Flag sessions that match doom loop patterns

### Intervention Timing
- **Early Warning**: Detect patterns after 2-3 error-fix cycles
- **Circuit Breaker**: Suggest breaks before user investment becomes too high
- **Alternative Paths**: Offer different approaches when current path is problematic

## Success Metrics

- **Time Saved**: Reduction in hours spent on ultimately abandoned approaches
- **Complexity Reduction**: Simpler final solutions compared to initial AI suggestions
- **User Satisfaction**: Decreased frustration with AI coding tools
- **Pattern Learning**: Users developing better instincts for recognizing doom loops

## Research Validation

Based on documented patterns:
- "After a few weeks, the cracks start to show" - common progression in AI coding
- "LLMs build jumbled messes at scale" - complexity accumulation problem
- "Net negative cost" - when AI assistance becomes counterproductive

## Future Enhancements

1. **Doom Loop Prediction**: Predict likely doom loops before they start
2. **Collaborative Learning**: Share anonymized doom loop patterns across users
3. **AI Tool Integration**: Direct integration with Cursor, Claude, Copilot to provide real-time warnings
4. **Recovery Automation**: Automatically suggest simplified starting points for common problems
