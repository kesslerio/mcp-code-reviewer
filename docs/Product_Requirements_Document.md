# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Anti-Pattern Coach: MCP-Native Engineering Excellence Platform

**Version**: 2.0  
**Date**: January 2025  
**Status**: Final for Implementation  
**Architecture**: Independent FastMCP Server  

---

## Executive Summary

**Anti-Pattern Coach** is an independent MCP server that prevents systematic engineering failures through real-time anti-pattern detection and educational coaching. Built specifically for integration with Claude Code CLI workflows, it transforms hard-won lessons from real-world failures into actionable prevention guidance.

**Strategic Positioning**: The first MCP-native anti-pattern prevention coach that integrates educational systematic failure prevention directly into Claude Code workflows.

**Market Differentiation**: While CodeRabbit provides enterprise team automation and PR-Agent offers multi-platform review capabilities, Anti-Pattern Coach focuses exclusively on educational prevention of systematic patterns that cause long-term technical debt.

---

## Problem Statement & Market Opportunity

### Core Problem
Technical leaders (product managers who code, technical leads) repeatedly fall into systematic anti-patterns that cause months or years of technical debt. Analysis of the Cognee integration retrospective revealed 4 critical failure patterns that compound into massive technical debt:

1. **Infrastructure Without Implementation**: Building custom solutions when standard APIs exist (2+ years of failed Cognee integration)
2. **Symptom-Driven Development**: Treating symptoms vs. addressing root causes  
3. **Complexity Escalation**: Adding complexity instead of questioning necessity
4. **Documentation Neglect**: Building custom before checking official approaches

### Market Gap
**Current State**: Existing tools focus on general code quality (CodeRabbit), team process automation (GitHub Actions), or broad static analysis. **None** specifically target systematic anti-pattern prevention with educational coaching.

**Our Opportunity**: Specialized educational prevention of systematic failures for individual technical leaders using Claude Code workflows.

### Target User: "Alex the Vibe Coder"
- **Role**: Senior PM or Technical Lead who codes
- **Company**: Mid-stage SaaS startup (50-200 employees)  
- **Workflow**: Uses `claude -p` for development assistance
- **Pain Point**: Time pressure leads to anti-patterns that create technical debt
- **Motivation**: Ship value quickly while making decisions engineering team will appreciate

## Product Vision & Strategy

### Vision Statement
> **"Prevent systematic engineering failures before they become technical debt"**

### Mission
Transform hard-won lessons from real-world engineering failures into an MCP-powered coaching system that prevents anti-patterns at architectural decision points.

### Strategic Positioning
```
Market Positioning:
├── Enterprise Platforms (CodeRabbit, GitHub Copilot)
│   └── Focus: Team automation, comprehensive review
├── Open Source Tools (PR-Agent, Claude Hub)  
│   └── Focus: Automation, webhook integration
├── GitHub Actions Ecosystem
│   └── Focus: CI/CD integration, workflow automation
└── Anti-Pattern Coach (Our Position)
    └── Focus: Educational prevention, MCP integration, individual coaching
```

**Core Value Propositions**:
1. **Educational First**: Explain WHY patterns are problematic with real case studies
2. **Prevention Focus**: Catch patterns at decision points, not just in code
3. **MCP Native**: Seamless Claude Code ecosystem integration  
4. **Individual Empowerment**: Personal coaching vs. team process automation
5. **Systematic Specialization**: Target specific failure patterns that compound

## User Experience & Workflow Integration

### Primary User Workflow (MCP Integration)
```bash
# Natural language interaction within existing Claude Code workflow
claude -p @anti-pattern-coach "analyze issue 123 for infrastructure anti-patterns"

# Complex multi-step analysis  
claude -p "Review this PR and @anti-pattern-coach check for systematic patterns, then suggest improvements"

# Educational queries
claude -p "@anti-pattern-coach explain infrastructure-without-implementation with Cognee case study"

# Integration validation
claude -p "@anti-pattern-coach validate building custom HTTP client for Stripe API"
```

### Secondary Interface (CLI Fallback)
```bash
# For users who prefer direct commands or when MCP unavailable
anti-pattern-coach issue 123
anti-pattern-coach code --file src/main.py
anti-pattern-coach explain infrastructure-without-implementation
anti-pattern-coach configure --setup-mcp
```

### MCP Server Configuration

{
  "anti-pattern-coach": {
    "command": "python", 
    "args": ["-m", "anti_pattern_coach.server"],
    "env": {

  educational_content:
    why_problematic: |
      Building custom solutions before testing standard APIs leads to
      2+ years of technical debt. The Cognee integration failed because
      we built custom HTTP servers instead of using documented approach.
    
    case_study:
      title: "Cognee Integration Failure"
      timeline: "2+ years of technical debt"

## Privacy & Security Requirements

### Privacy Philosophy
**Minimal data collection**:
- **No Code Content**: Never collect or transmit actual code
- **No External Analytics**: No usage tracking or telemetry
- **Local Processing**: All analysis happens locally  
- **User Control**: Users control what data is processed

### Data Handling
**Local Data Only**:
- Configuration stored in `~/.anti-pattern-coach/`
- Cache stored locally for performance
- No external data transmission except:
  - GitHub API calls (user-initiated)
  - MCP protocol communication (user-initiated)

**GitHub Integration**:
- **Read-only access**: Issue and PR metadata only
- **User tokens**: Users provide their own GitHub tokens
- **No storage**: GitHub data not permanently stored
- **Rate limiting**: Respect GitHub API limits

## Risk Analysis & Mitigation

### Technical Risks
**MCP Protocol Complexity**:
- **Risk**: More complex than simple CLI subprocess calls
- **Mitigation**: Use FastMCP framework, start with simple tools

**Claude Code Dependency**:
- **Risk**: Users may not have Claude Code installed
- **Mitigation**: Provide fallback CLI mode, clear setup documentation

**Performance Overhead**:
- **Risk**: MCP protocol adds latency vs. direct calls
- **Mitigation**: Cache responses, optimize tool execution

### Market Risks
**Limited Audience**:
- **Risk**: "Vibe coder" audience too small for meaningful adoption
- **Mitigation**: Focus on personal value first, organic growth second

**Competition from Major Players**:
- **Risk**: CodeRabbit adds anti-pattern detection features
- **Mitigation**: Focus on educational approach and individual workflow

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Start Simple**: Basic MCP tools first, add complexity gradually
- **Documentation First**: Clear setup and usage examples
- **Fallback Modes**: CLI interface when MCP unavailable
- **Community Support**: Leverage FastMCP and MCP protocol communities

## Conclusion

Anti-Pattern Coach represents a unique opportunity to serve the underserved market of individual technical leaders who need educational coaching beyond what enterprise team tools provide. By building as an independent MCP server with FastMCP, we can achieve seamless integration with Claude Code workflows while maintaining the specialized focus on systematic failure prevention that differentiates us from general code review platforms.

The path forward is clear: build an independent MCP server optimized for anti-pattern prevention that provides educational value through real-world case studies and actionable prevention strategies. This approach enables the `claude -p @anti-pattern-coach` workflow the user desires while positioning for future ecosystem growth and community adoption.

**Strategic Recommendation**: Proceed with FastMCP server implementation as primary architecture, with confidence that this approach addresses the identified market gap while positioning for future ecosystem growth.
