Anti-Pattern Coach FastMCP Server

Main MCP server entry point that provides anti-pattern detection capabilities
via the Model Context Protocol. Built on top of the validated Phase 1 core 
detection engine (87.5% accuracy, 0% false positives).

Usage:
    python -m anti_pattern_coach.server
    
Or programmatically:
    from anti_pattern_coach.server import run_server
    run_server()
